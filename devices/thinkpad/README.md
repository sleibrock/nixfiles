# Thinkpad NixOS

This is the folder for any configuration files specific to my Lenovo Thinkpad.

The Thinkpad has one hard drive, 8GB of RAM and an Intel i7 4th generation mobile CPU. The hard drive, a solid state, is about 250GB in total. 16GB of SWAP should be allocated on the SDD, and the rest will go to EXT4 root partition.
