# Desktop NixOS

This is the section for my desktop's NixOS hardware configurations. Currently it has 3 different hard drives, two solid states and one 5400RPM Seagate hard drive.

The main NixOS partition sits on a 100GB solid state Kingston hard drive, with 8GB allocated for SWAP and the rest for the main partition.
